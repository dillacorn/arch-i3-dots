### How to Sync the `btop` Theme with Your i3 Theme Changes

1. **Launch `btop` with `rofi`:**
   - Open `rofi` and type `btop` to start the program.

2. **Change the Theme:**
   - Inside `btop`, go to the settings menu.
   - Find the theme option and select `"TTY"` as your theme.

3. **Exit `btop`:**
   - After setting the theme to `TTY`, close `btop` to save the changes.

4. **Automatic Theme Syncing:**
   - Now, whenever you run your i3 theme-changing scripts, the `TTY` theme in `btop` will automatically update to match.

> **Note:**  
> It's better to configure `btop` directly on each system instead of sharing a configuration file, as different setups might cause `btop` to break.
