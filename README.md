## Keybinds: **DWM** Inspired
My keybinds (see [i3 config](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/config)) are heavily inspired by [**suckless DWM**](https://dwm.suckless.org/). Before switching to i3, I used [**DWM Flexipatch**](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) by [bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby) â€” DWM was my first window manager.

### P.S.
My goal is to learn as much as I can with X11, with the hope that this knowledge can eventually be applied to a separate repository using Sway-wm and/or Hyprland-wm.

At present, i3-wm seems more flexible (especially for gaming), but with ongoing developments, it's likely that the gap will eventually close, and we may all need to transition to a Wayland-based window manager.
