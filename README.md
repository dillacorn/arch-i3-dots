## Keybinds: **DWM** Inspired
My keybinds (see [i3 config](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/config)) are heavily inspired by [**suckless DWM**](https://dwm.suckless.org/). Before switching to i3, I used [**DWM Flexipatch**](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) by [bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby) â€” DWM was my first window manager.

## i3 Keybind Custom Scripts/Commands

Here are some of my custom keybinds from the i3 configuration:

- `mod4+shift+q` = **Reload i3 config**  
  - Reloads the current i3 configuration to apply any changes.
  - Additionally randomizes wallpaper in `~/Pictures/wallpapers` directory. <- if you don't want this behavior modify the ([i3 config](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/config)).
  
- `mod4+shift+r` = **Rotate i3 mod navigation**  
  - Switches between `mod1(alt)` and `mod4(win/super)` navigation using a script: [rotate_config_navigation.sh](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/rotate_config_navigation.sh).

- `mod1+ctrl+shift+p` = **i3 Power Menu**  
  - Activates Selectable Power Menu script: [i3exit.sh](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/i3exit.sh).
  - Escape(ESC) to cancel power menu.

- `mod4+shift+t` = **i3 Theme Changer**
  - Launches a theme selector using Rofi: [View avaliable theme scripts](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/tree/main/config/i3/themes).
  - You can easily add your own theme scripts to `~/.config/i3/themes`
  
- `mod4+shift+g` = **Capture a GIF**  
  - Starts a GIF recording with the script: [gif.sh](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/gif.sh).  
  - **Repeat the keybind to finish recording!**
  - `gif_date_time.gif` saved in `~/Videos` directory.
  
- `mod4+shift+s` = **Grim screenshot**  
  - Takes a screenshot using Grim.

## i3 Navigation

Here are more example keybinds from my i3 config:

Let me preface `"mod"` can equal `"mod1"` and/or `"mod4"` depending on [script navigation rotation](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/rotate_config_navigation.sh)

  - Closes the focused window.

- `mod+f` = **Toggle Floating**
  - Toggles between tiling and floating window layouts.

- `mod+shift+f` = **Toggle Fullscreen**

### Installing i3-WM and Related Applications with Scripts

Install Arch Repo applications using [install script](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/scripts/install_my_arch_repo_apps.sh). This script installs essential tools and applications like i3-wm, Rofi, Dunst, and more.

Install Arch AUR applications using [install script](https://github.com/dillacorn/arch-i3-dots/blob/main/scripts/install_my_aur_repo_apps.sh). This script installs essential applications like ungoogled-chromium, spotify, obs, and more.

### P.S.
My goal is to learn as much as I can with X11, with the hope that this knowledge can eventually be applied to a separate repository using Sway-wm and/or Hyperland-wm.

At present, i3-wm seems more flexible (especially for gaming), but with ongoing developments, it's likely that the gap will eventually close, and we may all need to transition to a Wayland-based window manager.
